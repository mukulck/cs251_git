\section{SHOLAY MOVIE REVIEWS}
------------------------------

After his family is murdered by a notorious and ruthless bandit,
a former police officer enlists the services of two outlaws to capture the bandit. 

\subsection{Review1}
------------------------------
If you liked "Once upon a time in the west", "The magnificent seven" and "A fistful of dollars", you will love "Sholay". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest "curry" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the "spaghetti" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after. A masterpiece. 

\subsection{Review2}
---------------------------------
 Great Movie... Everyone should have seen this movie at least one time !
 I bought this movie on DVD now, although I am not a big fan of elder films... 
 i love this film, and especially the dialogs of GB ! For all Amitabh fans its a must have movie 
 
 ! The whole story is really good and the movie has a flair of an American western. Even the sound of Sholay
 and the atmosphere which is given to the watcher are one of the best i have seen in Bollywood. I have heard
 , there will be a remake of this film, but I think it could not be as good as the original Sholay.
 All because of the actors like Amjad Khan who was born for this role.
 This film is one of bollywood's best movies ever.
