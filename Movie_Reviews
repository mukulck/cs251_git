\section{SHOLAY MOVIE REVIEWS}
------------------------------

After his family is murdered by a notorious and ruthless bandit,
a former police officer enlists the services of two outlaws to capture the bandit. 

\subsection{Review1}
------------------------------
If you liked "Once upon a time in the west", "The magnificent seven" and "A fistful of dollars", you will love "Sholay". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest "curry" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the "spaghetti" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after. A masterpiece. 
The film features the acting talents of such Bollywood legends...Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra and focuses at its heart, a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven.
\subsection{Review2}
---------------------------------
 I am shocked seeing that the IMDb ratings for this classic is just 6.6. Why? Because the movie is strongly influenced from the Westerns? or It it isn't entertaining enough?

The 2nd cant be true because the movie had everything: strong script strong direction excellent characters and performances good action,comedy,romance,friendship,etc

If the 1st is true then i feel sorry for the viewers because being influenced is not being copied.Besides there would remain only like 50-60 original scripts if counted correctly.

I cannot find a single flaw in the movie which is my personal thinking and as it would be of true Hindi cinema fans.

So people please judge the movie on its merits and not on something which is totally baseless.

\subsection}{Review3}
---------------------------------
This movie has everything, comedy, action, drama, romance, fun, emotions. Great performance by all the characters. They are remembered even today in 2004 after nearly 30 years of the film release. I heard that this movie is now re-released with remastered sound. 

The most impressive role of Gabbar by Amjad Khan was portrayed extremely well. 

Its also one the longest movie. Its quite normal for bollywood movies to be 3 hours long. But this one is even longer than this. But certainly ever minute of the movie is enjoyable.

This movie is my all time favorite.
