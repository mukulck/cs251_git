\section{SHOLAY MOVIE REVIEWS}
------------------------------

After his family is murdered by a notorious and ruthless bandit,
a former police officer enlists the services of two outlaws to capture the bandit. 

\subsection{Review1}
------------------------------
If you liked "Once upon a time in the west", "The magnificent seven" and "A fistful of dollars", you will love "Sholay". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest "curry" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the "spaghetti" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after. A masterpiece.
